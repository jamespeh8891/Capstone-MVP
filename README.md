# Capstone-MVP
The big picture: I'm creating a website for my buddy Sam who creates music. For the website he asked if there could be different pages displaying his albums and all of the songs in that album. There will be a sign up page allowing the user to fill out a form and become a member of the website. Although you wont actually be able to listen to his songs through the website you can always come back to the website and favorite a song. There will be a about me page that is a short biography on my friend so you can learn more about him.
